# sm-Mechanical-3DOF-task2
## Overview

This repository contains a Word document that calculates both forward and inverse kinematics of a 3-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) robot arm. Forward kinematics computes the position of the end effector given joint angles, while inverse kinematics determines the joint angles required to position the end effector at a specified point in space.
